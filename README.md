========

Just a starting point for development projects

- run ```sudo npm install``` to install dependancies

- run ```grunt polling``` to watch the directory for changes to html, php, js, sass and images and trigger live reloads.

- run ```grunt jserrors``` to check js files for errors and format issues.

- run ```grunt build``` prior to deployments to validate and package it up.
